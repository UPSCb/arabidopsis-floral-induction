# arabidopsis-floral-induction
The objective of this project is to identify genes that are differentially expressed during floral induction in Arabidopsis. We have collected samples using a Dexamethasone inducible system that triggers floral induction upon treatment. Provided samples are total RNA from apex and leaf tissues from Arabidopsis. Samples were collected at Day 1 (D1; control, no treatment), D1 (mock and Dexa) and D3 (mock and dexa). We provide three biological replicates for each time point and condition (details of the samples will be provided in an excel file). Total number of samples is 30 (15 leaf samples and 15 apex samples).
