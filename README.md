## Abstract
Integration of environmental and endogenous cues triggers floral induction at the optimal time during the plant life cycle. Flowering is a tightly regulated process where several metabolites are known to contribute to the determination of flowering time, including carbohydrates and hormones. However, a global analysis of metabolic changes associated with flowering is still lacking. We performed a metabolomic study to characterise global metabolic changes associated with photoperiodic floral induction. We used system based on an inducible version of CONSTANS (CO) to trigger flowering and identify metabolites that increase or decrease in leaves and apices during floral induction. Combining metabolomic with transcriptomic data, we identify that raffinose metabolism was altered in apices that are induced to flower. Loss-of-function mutants affecting RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE 5 (RS5), a key enzyme of the raffinose metabolism, show an early flowering phenotype. Also, RS5 expression changes during floral transition, suggesting a role for raffinose catabolism on the release of mono and disaccharides at the apex. We propose that variation on the differential accumulation of raffinose and mono- and disaccharides during floral transition contributes to the induction of floral transition, by influencing expression of key genes in controlling expression of the florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), such as THEHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 (TPS1) and SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 3 (SPL3).
